This coming First Friday, June 5th (from 6-10pm), I'll be sharing a collection of images hosted by [Gravy Studio](http://www.gravy-studio.com/) in [Fishtown](https://goo.gl/maps/VGJVi). Over the past nine months I've spent time wandering the space that winds above the Callowhill neighborhood -- attempting to capture how we know it today.

Soon, the [Reading Viaduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Viaduct) will no longer exist in the form it has for over twenty years, and we should celebrate that existence while looking forward to the coming improvement. We're going to see change from a space for urban art, exploration, and wondering "how do I even get up there?" to space the city will be proud to improve, maintain, and share with the masses.

Keep watch at [@_ksho](https://instagram.com/_ksho/) and [@gravy_studio](https://instagram.com/gravy_studio/) for updates.

Hope to see you there!
