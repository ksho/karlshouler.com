[Spruce Street Harbor Park](http://www.delawareriverwaterfront.com/places/spruce-street-harbor-park) is a summer pop-up-type installation on the Delaware River filled with hammocks, sand, and over-sized games (I spotted large chess pieces and tic-tac-toe). Garces has some hand in the food and drink served out of shipping containers a la [last summer's PHS garden at Spruce and Broad](http://karlshouler.com/blog/2013/08/08/popup-beer-garden/). They've also included a serious array of lights in the water and trees that constantly rotate hue.

For the photo nerds, this was shot at 1/8s, f/4.0, ISO2500.
